{{< blocks/cover title="About Anton Sankov" image_anchor="bottom" height="min" >}}

<p class="lead mt-5">
<p>
  My name is Anton Sankov!
</p>

<p>
  I am an aspiring software developer, currently working at VMware Carbon Black.
</p>

<p>
  I am also a Core Team member of Kiwi TCMS - the leading Open Source Test Case Management System.
</p>

<p>
  I started this blog to share my knowledge with other people.
</p>

<p>
  You can expect to find articles on various topics, mostly things I have encountered in my daily job,
  where I am currently focused on building a SaaS product for Kubernetes Security.
</p>

<p>
  This involves writing highly-scalable, distributed microservices in Go, which not only protect Kubernetes,
  but also run in Kubernetes themselves.
</p>

<p>
  I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and have done so at a few conferences.
  You can check them out at the Public Speaking tab. TODO
